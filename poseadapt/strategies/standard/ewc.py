    """
    Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) plugin.

    EWC computes importance of each parameter at the end of training on current
    experience. During training on each mini batch, the loss is augmented
    with a penalty which keeps the value of the current weights close to the
    value they had on previous experiences in proportion to their importance
    on that experience. Importances are computed with an additional pass on the
    training set.

    This plugin does not use experience identities.

    Args:
        alpha (float): A hyperparameter that balances the base and regularization loss
                            components. Values range from 0 to 1, where higher values prioritize
                            knowledge retention over learning new information, enhancing the
                            model's stability.

        mode (str): Specifies the method of accumulating penalties across tasks.
                    - `separate`: Maintains a distinct penalty for each previous experience,
                      allowing unique regularization for each task's learned parameters.
                    - `online`: Aggregates all penalties into a single term using a decay factor,
                      which simplifies the regularization across all tasks into one evolving term.

        decay_factor (Optional[float]): A decay multiplier applied to the importance values in
                                        `online` mode. This factor reduces the influence of older
                                        tasks' importances over time, focusing more on recent tasks.
                                        This parameter is ignored if the mode is not set to `online`.

        keep_importance_data (bool): Determines whether to retain the importance values and
                                     parameter states for all tasks or just the most recent.
                                     - If True, stores importance values and parameters for every
                                       task, which increases memory usage but allows for detailed
                                       historical analysis and more precise reversions to past states.
                                     - If False, only the latest task's data is retained, minimizing
                                       memory footprint.
                                     - Note: When mode is `separate`, this is always set to True,
                                       as each task's unique data is necessary for separate penalties.
